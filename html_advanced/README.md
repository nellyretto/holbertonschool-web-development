`0. README and objectives!`

For this task, please write an amazing README.md
---
`1. Header`
Let’s start at the top: the header

* Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)

* In the body, add a header tag

* Inside this header:

Add a link element with an image inside

Add a block of 3 link elements
---
`2. Banner`

Add a main tag that has a section element inside.

* In this section element, add:
 
A block containing:

A heading tag (level 1, don’t forget to use the correct heading value)<br>
A text element<br>
A button tag

* Another block containing:
<br>
<br>
Another heading tag (level 2, be careful about which one you are using)<br>
A block containing 4 blocks - each block containing:<br>
An image<br>
A heading tag (level 3)<br>
A text
---
`3. Quote`

The quote section is inside the main:

* Create a new section for the quote

* Inside, add a block containing:

An image<br>
Another block with inside:<br>
A blockquote tag<br>
A text tag for the quote author<br>
Another text

---

`4. Videos`

New section containing:

* A heading tag (level 1)
* A block containing the 4 video blocks - each of them are composed with:
An image

A heading (level 2)

A text

Add a block for the author information:

An image

A heading (level 3)

A block for the rating:

A block of images (one star = one image)

A text

---
`5. Membership`

* After the videos list section, add a new section containing:

A heading (level 1)

A block containing 4 block items - each block containing:

An image

A heading (level 2)

A text

A button


---
`6. FAQ`

Add a section for the FAQ containing:

* A heading (level 1)
* A block that contains 2 “row blocks”
* Each “row block” contains 2 “item blocks”
* Each “item block” is composed of:
A heading (level 2)

A text

*Hint: There is no “row block” tag, “row” is referring to the styling that will be applied in a future project. It just means two “rows” containing two “items” each, also containing their own elements.*

---
`7. Footer`

After the last section, outside of the main, add a footer:

* A block (used later for centering the footer content), inside this block:
'
Another block with:<br>
An image<br>
Another block containing:<br>
3 Images with link<br>
A text<br>

*And… that’s it for the moment - the result should not be shiny, don’t worry, CSS is coming…*
